# Curriculumn
Life-long curriculumn what I've learned and what haven't.

My memory organization depends only on associativity. 
Most of the time, I learn something and almost always 
forget the details. Only storing the general rules or principle, 
blending it in what already in my mind. Any details left faded..

To the awesomeness of God-blessed human brain, association
sometime can be used to pin up those details. It's a kind of
pointer, but fuzzy and indeterministic, but works. Therefor,
I created this repository, as a way to store those pointer
on what I've learned: what when why, that usually led to how.

This might be someway as an overview to my knowledge.

Another note, many details are obscured.
