# Rust Language :crab:
It includes native tools and infrastructures, native-built web apps, native-powered mobile apps, microcontroller program. 
Everything that can be powered with Rust.

## 2016: Introduction
Knowing Rust as, fancy complexion beast. At that time, I've known C++ and feel that it simpler than Rust.
"How on earth C++ is simpler than Rust?" Today I said.

## 2017: Attached to Rust
After learning OCaml, Haskel, and functional programming paradigm. Knowing Rust is... that's mine!
It is seamless, sensible, low-level but simpler language. That zero abstraction though! (Means high level but fast)
Moreover, it is open community created by Mozilla, what's less from it?

## 2018: Rustodoro Project
It is just Pomodoro outside and more of it inside, see [here](https://github.com/Abdillah/rustodoro). 
In one simple timer project, learning to,

- Compile Rust to NPM environment (WASM using Neon).
- Setup Electron-based apps.
- Using Rust's NCurses lib.

The goal is to create a Hydra, multihead UI powered by one backend codebase.

## 2019: Internal Ubiquity Project
This is internal project that I kept secret. Will be published into a product after finished.
I learned,

- Tweaking Cargo extension, [Cargo APK](https://github.com/Abdillah/android-rs-glue).
- Compile Rust into APK with LibSDL (early, ongoing).
